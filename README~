If you want to be a part of the project, send me an email :)
#############################################################

To run the project, you'll need a few things.
1. Python 2. It probably needs to be later than 2.4.
2. Pygame for your installation of python.
3. The images etc, but they should be in the repo anyway.

Remember, this project is still very much a work in progress.
I'd say I've only spend 2 hours or so on this, so WHEN you 
find bugs, it would be handy if you report them :D
Also, this is not intended to be 100% accurate. I'm not a
Masters-degree physicist DX


If you are having issues, email me :)
